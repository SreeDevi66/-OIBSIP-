# Simple Calculator (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This is a small, responsive calculator demo built with HTML, CSS Grid and vanilla JavaScript. It supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percent, clear and delete. Keyboard input is supported.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main page with calculator markup.
- `css/styles.css` — styles and layout using CSS Grid.
- `js/script.js` — calculator logic, event listeners, keyboard support and a Demo button.

How to run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# Open the folder in Explorer and double-click index.html,
# or run a simple HTTP server if you prefer:
python -m http.server 8000; Start-Process "http://localhost:8000/index.html"
```

Usage:
- Click buttons or use keyboard (`0-9`, `.`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `Enter` for equals, `Backspace` to delete, `Esc` to clear).
- Click "For Demo Click" to run a short sample sequence (12 + 7 = 19).

Want changes? I can add more features: parentheses, advanced functions, or prettier styling.
