            <p class="legacy-text">
                Dr. Kalam's legacy extends far beyond his scientific contributions. He was a true teacher at heart, dedicating his post-presidential years to inspiring young minds across India. He believed that youth held the key to India's future and worked tirelessly to ignite their minds with scientific temperament and patriotic fervor.
            </p>
            <p class="legacy-text">
                His humility, despite his towering achievements, made him relatable to millions. He remained a bachelor throughout his life, dedicating himself entirely to the service of the nation. His simplicity, his love for children, and his unwavering faith in India's potential continue to inspire generations.
            </p>
            <p class="legacy-text">
                Even in death, he exemplified his life's mission - he passed away while delivering a lecture to students, literally dying with his boots on, doing what he loved most: teaching and inspiring the youth of India.
